# Demo

The 'git status' command shows me all of the files that were updated or created or deleted but haven't been saved in a
commit yet.

You need to use the 'git add' command to track untracked files.

A period at the end of 'git add .' track all of the files that are listed in a directory.

'origin' is the location of our git repository where 'master' is the branch that we want to push to.
